# Lebo's site

It's a simple portfolio site landing page.
I created it using just HTML, CSS & JS(mainly to toggle the navbar on small devices)

In the meantime there's not much that's interesting about this project but I will be updating overtime as my coding and web design skills get better.
Feel free to do as you wish with the source code and the design Idea.
